# gsheet-to-json - json output from gsheet
You will need a ```credential.json``` in ```conf``` which is not in the repo and should never be. Get your local copy and never commit it to repo

copy ```conf/config.yml.dist``` as ```conf/config.yml``` and do not commit the copied file

usage:
```
cd /${doculaboration-source-location}/gsheet-to-json/src
./json-from-gsheet.py --config '../conf/config.yml'
python json-from-gsheet.py --config "../conf/config.yml"
```
