TEXLive contains the otfinfo command line program, which can query this information; for example
otfinfo -i `kpsewhich lmroman10-regular.otf`


LuaTEX users only In order to load fonts by their name rather than by their filename (e.g., 'Latin Modern Roman' instead of'ec-lmr10'), you may need to run the script luaotfload-tool, which is distributed with the luaotfload package.

luaotfload-tool





    sudo apt-get purge texlive*

    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/* and rm -rf ~/.texlive*

    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/texmf

    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/texmf

    sudo rm -rf /etc/texmf

    sudo apt-get remove tex-common --purge

    rm -rf ~/.texlive

    find -L /usr/local/bin/ -lname /usr/local/texlive/*/bin/* | xargs -r rm

    This finds all the files in /usr/local/bin which point to a location within /usr/local/texlive/*/bin/* and removes them; because weâ€™ve already deleted all of /usr/local/texlive, these are dead links. To see which files are being deleted, replace xargs rm with xargs -t rm (or tee off to a log file, or whatever).
