Earlier you wrote something in relation to BKB's claim #22 under the section *b. Actual findings related to the claim*

2. Claimant’s entitlement to damages. The claimant’s Statement of Claim seeks compensation for specific losses—such as lost business opportunities and reputational harm—caused by BKB’s misrepresentations and wrongful termination [9]. The claimant’s damages claim is supported by evidence of performance (UAT, limited live operation and implemented features) and by BKB’s breaches (wrongful termination, non‑cooperation and engagement of competing vendors) [5] [6] [7].			

3. No lawful termination or breach by the claimant. As previously demonstrated, BKB failed to provide the required ninety‑day notice before termination and demanded uncontracted hardware [1] [4]. The claimant delivered the platform and performed its obligations. Under section 73 of the Contract Act, BKB cannot claim compensation when it is the party in breach.
